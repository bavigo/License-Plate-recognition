# License-Plate-recognition
This is a pre-trained model which identifies the license plate present in the image and crop that license plate image. By using the Optical Character Recognition technology , it recognises the characters present in the cropped image and produces the output using the tkinter GUI Interface.

For running this project,pc must contain jupyter notebook or vscode jupyter extension and python 3.5 or above.If those IDE's is not installed in your system follow the links to install them.
install some other libraries like OpenCV,Numpy,Matplotlib,imutils,pytessaract,easyocr,tkinter

installation on windows - https://medium.com/@kswalawage/install-python-and-jupyter-notebook-to-windows-10-64-bit-66db782e1d02

if you are using the linux(ubuntu) distribution follow the steps.

 run the command   -             sudo apt update                                                         #command
 for upgrading packages   -      sudo apt-get upgrade                                                    #command
 for installation of python  -   sudo apt install python3                                                #command deb
 
 Download the Vscode .debfile from official website and run the following command
 for vscode  installation               -   sudo apt install ./<file>.deb
 then go to the extensions in the vscode and install jupyter extension.
 
 
 then install pip3 module               -sudo apt install python3-pip
 
  install the python libararies.
 for OpenCV                             - pip install opencv-python
 for OpenCV contribs                    - pip install opencv-contrib-python
 for Numpy                              - pip install numpy
 for Matplotlib                         - pip install matplotlib
 for imutils                            - pip install imutils
 for pytessaract                        - pip install pytessaract
 for easyocr                            - pip install easyocr
 for tkinter                            - pip install tkintertable
 
 for knowing about how the modules will work go through the official documentation at https://pypi.org/
 
  after installation
  
  create a file named main.ipynb in vscode jupyter extension
  now copy the code and save the code in that main.ipynb file which is written in test.ipynb

  i am uploading the referral images here for cd imageross-checking at everyphase.
